For the Studio 1 final project, I had to create a website based on the portfolio I had at the time. 

The portfolio included a GIS project I had completed, a toyota website redesign, McDonalds App redesign, and a Twister Movie poster design I came up with. 

The reference I used for this project was W3School.com which is my go to reference for all things web development related. https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/default.asp

Some of the tools used in this project include VS Code, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, XAMPP, and GIMP.
